# Mental-Health-Diagnostic-KBS
This is my project for the Knowledge-Based Systems module SS2025 THD.

The project aims to utilise an ontology of three major groups of disorders, MDD, BPD and anxiety disorder, to "diagnose patients" via assigning specific episodes from given symptoms.

It utilises an RDF ontology, a symptom map generated from the ontology, a streamlit GUI app with fuzzy matching as a feature, and a diagnostic pipeline using Python and HermiT.
